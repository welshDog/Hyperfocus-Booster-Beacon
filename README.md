## 🔬 **The Science Behind It**

This isn't just pretty lights and sounds - it's **evidence-based focus technology**:

- **Beta waves (12-16Hz)** are often lower in ADHD brains - we target this specifically
- **Flow state triggers** like immediate feedback, clear goals, and challenge/skill balance
- **Sensory integration** techniques for neurodivergent processing styles
- **Micro-task priming** based on cognitive load theory

Built with input from neurodivergent developers and ADHD research! 🧬
